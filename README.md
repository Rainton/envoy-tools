# envoy-tools
Companion tooling for Envoy proxy. Currently this consists of envoy-curses, a
terminal-based UI for visualizing Envoy's admin server.

# envoy-curses

Currently alpha quality. See the [README](./envoy-curses/README.md) for
installation and usage instructions. It has been tested with the Envoy example
configs, but may have surprising and/or broken behavior with other setups.

# csds-client

The CSDS client is developed as a generic tool that can be used/extended to work with different xDS control planes. See the [README](./csds-client/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
